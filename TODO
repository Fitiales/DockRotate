* proper electricity consumption

* localization

* move staticizeRotation() to RotationAnimation

* handle vessel structure change during rotation properly
	* store initial orgRot and orgPos
	* update part orgRot ant orgPos during motion
	* if rotation aborts, part orgRot and orgPos are always updated

* finish docking port sr. support

* add inline docking port support
	* redesign rotationAxis() to get information from ModuleDockingNode
	* dockingNode transform not useful, loks like world space

* refactor checkGuiActive() to remove the guiList[] logic

* check imprecise rotate to snap stop
