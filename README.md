# DockRotate

Needing foldable arms for antennas on your satellites?

Wanting to try VTOL vehicles with moving engines?

Tired of misaligned solar panel trusses on your space stations?

This plugin can help you.

Docked port pairs can rotate via right-click menu or action groups. ( * )
They can rotate to snap for perfect alignment.
And if you want to uninstall the module, you won't lose any ship, because there's no new parts involved. Your station parts will stay aligned, and your satellite arms will stay deployed.

When a rotation starts, all autostruts on the vessel are disabled. They reappear with timewarp, or when the vessel goes out of physics range.

( * ) Should work with any port based on ModuleDockingNode. Clamp-O-Tron Sr. can rotate only when docked in flight.
