* proper electricity consumption

* localization

* move staticizeRotation() to RotationAnimation
	* probably better to move just the joint handling and leave orgPos/orgRot updates in ModuleDockRotate
	* update _propagate() to use STd() and STp()

* handle vessel structure change during rotation properly
	* use abort() function when vessel part count changes
	* use it on docking port state change to prevent docking-while-moving problems

* finish docking port sr. support

* add inline docking port support
	* just one last bug to fix before release

* refactor checkGuiActive() to remove the guiList[] logic
